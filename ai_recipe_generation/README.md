This app was  a demo app created for the Google I/O talk "Gemini API and Flutter: Practical, AI-driven apps with Google AI tools"

Improved by me:
- UI
- logic
- prompts
- localization
- added ChatGpt model to compare results

To run the app:
# create constants.dart file and place it in the root directory. 
  provide following values:
  const api_key = 'your_key';
  const googleApiKey = 'your_key';
  const searchEngineId = 'your_key';
  const openAIKey = 'your_key' 
# connect project to Firebase
